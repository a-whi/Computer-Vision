Lab 4: Linear Regression for Prediction & Image Restoration

This lab investigates linear regression as a supervised learning method, progressing from simple predictive modelling to high-dimensional image restoration tasks. Linear regression models were implemented from first principles to analyse real-world data, including predicting life expectancy using socio-economic variables such as BMI, alcohol consumption, and GDP.

The lab then applied multivariate linear regression to restore corrupted facial images by learning a mapping between corrupted and clean image data. Model performance was evaluated on both training and unseen test data, highlighting generalisation behaviour. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) was implemented to quantitatively assess reconstruction quality, and a local neighbourhood-based regression approach was explored to improve restoration under random corruption patterns.

This lab demonstrates how classical machine learning techniques can be effectively applied to image analysis, restoration, and performance evaluation.
