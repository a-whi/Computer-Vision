# ECE4076 - Computer Vision

This repository contains coursework and lab implementations from a computer vision unit focused on extracting meaningful information from images, such as object structure, motion, shape, location, and identity. The work explores core techniques used in computer vision systems for robotics, surveillance, medical imaging, and related applications.

The repository includes the following labs:

- Fingerprint enhancement and minutiae extraction

- Image stitching using homographies

- Image segmentation and region proposal using k-means clustering, superpixels, and related methods

- Linear regression for visual data analysis
